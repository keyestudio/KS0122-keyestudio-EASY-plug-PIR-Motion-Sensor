# KS0122 keyestudio EASY plug PIR Motion Sensor

![](media/wps1.png)

## 1. Introduction

PIR stands for Pyroelectric Infrared (many times, they are also referred as Passive Infrared sensors). This is because their principle of operation is based on the detection of infrared energy emitted by a moving body.

The PIR sensor can detect infrared signals from a moving person or moving animal, outputting switching signals.

One important thing to mention is that when motion is detected, the output will stay high for 2.3 to 3 seconds after the motion stops.

Regarding the power supply, it can work with voltages of both 3.3V and 5V. The device has a detection range of 7 meters and a detection angle of 100º.

This module should be used together with EASY plug control board.

**Special Note:**

The sensor/module is equipped with the RJ11 6P6C interface, compatible with our keyestudio EASY plug Control Board with RJ11 6P6C interface.

If you have the control board of other brands, it is also equipped with the RJ11 6P6C interface but has different internal line sequence, can’t be used compatibly with our sensor/module.

## 5. Upload the Code

Download code:  [Code](./Code.7z)

```c
byte sensorPin = 6;
byte indicator = 13;

void setup()
{
    pinMode(sensorPin,INPUT);
    pinMode(indicator,OUTPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
    byte state = digitalRead(sensorPin);
    digitalWrite(indicator,state);
    if(state == 1)
    	Serial.println("Somebody is in this area!");
    else if(state == 0)
    	Serial.println("No one!");
    delay(500);
}
```

## 6. Result

Done uploading the code, open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 9600. If the sensor detects someone moving nearby, you should see the "Somebody is in this area!" is displayed on the monitor. Otherwise, it will display "No one!".
